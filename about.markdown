A companion blog to the [Ruby](https://rubystyle.guide), [Minitest](https://minitest.rubystyle.guide), [Rails](https://rails.rubystyle.guide) and [RSpec](https://rspec.rubystyle.guide) community style guides.

In the spirit of broader community collaboration we've started this blog so that
more people can see what we're working on, and participate in the discussions
around introducing new guidelines and changing existing ones.

Discussions have been happening for years on the issue trackers of the style guides, but we hope that this blog is going to help us to reach out to more people.
